[John Gostling](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-gostling-a461401a/) is Managing Director of [Breakwater](http://breakwaterit.co.uk/), an IT services provider offering solutions and support to a variety of organisations, from charities through to professional firms, leisure and tourism and the education sectors.

Breakwater takes the approach that by identifying a ‘platform’ of technologies that work together, standardising networks and procedures, real efficiencies and increased productivity can be created. Of course, staff are the most important element and Breakwater really believe that investing in staff and culture are key to performance.

John has been working within the IT industry for 20 years and is invested in creating a knowledge-driven team that understands their client needs. John will talk about his journey at Breakwater and the exciting innovations that have enabled their client-base to strengthen their IT infrastructures. He will give us an insight into some of the world-leading technologies partners Breakwater works with and the security, cloud and disaster recovery solutions.
